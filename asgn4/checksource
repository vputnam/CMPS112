NAME

   checksource - check source code for basic reasonable formatting

SYNOPSIS

   checksource [filename...]

DESCRIPTION

   Checks the input files for basic formatting sanity.  Prints
   complaints for strange looking files and a summary.  If no
   filenames are specified, prints out this man page.

OPERANDS

   Files to check for reasonable formatting.

COMPLAINTS

   The only invisible characters may be spaces and newlines,
   except for a Makefile, where some lines begin with a tab.
   Form feed is acceptable on a line by itself if used for
   formatting purposes.

   Printable characters are any ISO-Latin-1 characters in the
   range '!' to '~' and '�' to '�' (\\u0021 to \\u007E and
   \\u00A1 to \\u00FF).  See:  http://www.unicode.org/charts/.
   ASCII files contain a subset of these characters.

   Each line must end in a newline.  The last character of the
   file must be a newline.  M*cr*\$*ft format files are not
   acceptable.  If you use emacs, be sure that your .emacs file
   has:  (setq require-final-newline t)

   You may remove carriage returns from your file with one of
   the following commands:

   . Perl:    perl -pi -e 's/\\r//' filename
   . vi:      :g/^V^M/s///
   . shell:   dos2unix oldfilename >newfilename

   No line may have more than 72 characters before the newline.
   Or:  with ``cat -n | expand'', lines including line numbers
   should not be longer than 80 characters.  Long lines should
   be wrapped in a sensible place, such as after a comma, and
   properly indented on the next line.

   Indent with 3 spaces for each level, and do not use tabs.

   In a Makefile, a tab is required as the first character on a
   shell command, but should never be used after a non-TAB
   character.
